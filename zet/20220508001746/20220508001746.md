## BrainTrust

braintrust was setup in apple to bring in to adapt to need of sharing information over their core value of secrecy. This culture lead to conflict and burn out in different teams because of last minute merging of technology before lauches of new product.Airpods team was used as a test bench to work using braintrust.

The camera dev team was doing what i love to do, to have weekly meeting where people share that they are struggling on and get feeback from their collegues. 

Was the one who coined the term was Ed Catmull ans shared the important of sharing and collaboration in his book **creativity inc.**  
"egos off the table, building blocks on the table."


I do to see how companies are understanding the power of collaboration ansd knowledge sharing.It is also impressive how they are changing culture better for employs one step at a time. I like how they market shit like change in culture is "Different Together" which was happening pixar for ages. The only reason i feel apple didnt become irrelavant at this point is because the culture Steve Jobs. They have been money sucking machine with no regrads to amount of electronic waste they produce to fullfil their greed.
